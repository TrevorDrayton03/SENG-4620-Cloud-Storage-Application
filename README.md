## About 

### Introduction

Cloud computing is an internet-based distributed digital infrastructure resource that offers hosted services, and it has become an exceptionally popular tool for software companies to utilize.

The up-front cost of purchasing, maintaining, and configuring on-premise IT infrastructure can be very costly for software companies. Cloud computing offers many useful services that allows companies to service their customers without having to pay the costs of on-premise IT infrastructure; companies pay for the resources as they go.

This project is the cloud engineering of a system which replaces a file storage web application hosted locally on an on-premise computing infrastructure with a public cloud computing system.


### Design Problem

A file storage web application is hosted on an on-premise computing infrastructure, offering highly efficient data storage. Due to the surge in data traffic, current deployment is being proved inefficient because of its limited resources. Thus, users of the system are seeing performance and reliability issues.

To accommodate the increase in data traffic and maintain quality of service, the service provider is required to upgrade the on-premise infrastructure. This increases the operational and capital expenditure (OPEX and CPEX) for the service provider. 

As a result, the cost of the service increased causing customer dissatisfaction. As a solution, the file storage web-application service provider has decided to migrate the application to the public cloud to circumvent these issues.

The challenge for the cloud architect is to redesign the current system to be hosted on the public cloud, while maximizing the reliability, security and  sustainability, and minimizing the cost.
